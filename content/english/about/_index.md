## ABOUT OUR JOURNY

Home of Moroccan Educators & Students in America (HMEMSA) is a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that aims to contribute to the development and enrichment of vulnerable communities within Morocco. As the byproduct of some Moroccan American professionals in 2009, HMEMSA has maintained a strong commitment towards collaborating with the Moroccan community in the United States and abroad, to achieve measurable, sustainable development in the lives of those in need.

HMEMSA strives to work in collaboration with its partners to organize medical mission trips, cultural exchange programs, and educational seminars to empower and uplift the Moroccan community. Whether it is physical support or financial support, HMEMSA’s passion and commitment towards excellence ultimately ensures each project’s success.
